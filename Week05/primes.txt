numbers
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11

even numbers
2,4,6,8,10

prime number
2,3,5,7,11

anything divisble by 2 except 2 itself is not a prime number
therefore ignore anything divisible by 2 after 2 itself

it is a given that 2 is prime
starting at 3 and increment by 2 will ignore even  numbers this will halve the time taken
3,5,7,9,11,13,15
no need to do 4,6,8 etc as these have been taken care of by removing anything divisble by 2

remove anything divisible by 3 except 3 itself will further reduce the numbers
no need to do 6,9,12 etc as these have been taken care of by removing anything divisble by 2 & 3


division by 5 with the exception of 5 itself will remove more numbers
5,15,25

no need to do multiples of 6 as these have been taken care of by removing anything divisble by 2 & 3

division by 7 with the exception of 7 itself
7,14,21,28,35,42,49 == all below the square of 7 have been catered for by the above steps

8&9 have been taken care of by above steps.

so divisors 2,3,5,7 are all primes 



 
 conclusion as in lecture build up the primes into an array and divide the number by all the primes in that array


if the square of the number is greater than the total number of numbers dont bother with it? what is it with squares - look it up
1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100
